# Traffic Simulation System

## Description
This project simulates traffic flow on a road network to study vehicle movement,
congestion, and traffic behavior under different conditions.  
It is designed as an academic project to understand real-world traffic dynamics
using programming concepts.

## Features
- Simulation of vehicle movement on roads
- Traffic density and flow control
- Signal-based traffic handling (if implemented)
- Congestion analysis
- Console-based / graphical output (depending on implementation)

## Concepts Used
- Data Structures (arrays / queues / linked lists)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Simulation logic
- Mathematical modeling (if applicable)

## Technologies Used
- C++ / MATLAB *(modify as needed)*
- VS Code / MATLAB IDE

## How to Run

### For C++:
1. Open the project folder
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o traffic_simulation
